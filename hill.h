/** @brief This is the main function of the file and is being used for implementing 
 *        Hill Climbing algorithm.
 *  
 * How the algorithm works : 1. For each queen Qi, i = 1..N, place her in [i, Yi],
 *                           where Yi is selected at random 1..N.
 *                           2. Let T0 be the number of queens couples threatened with each other.
 *                           3. T = T0, x = 0, y = 0
 *                           4. For i = 1 to N // Find motion that minimizes threats
 *                              a. For j = 1 to N, j â‰  Yi
 *                             i. Let K be the number of threats that would exist if
 *                             queen Qi moved to [i, j].
 *                             ii. If K <T then
 *                               1. T = K, x = i, y = j
 *                          5. If T <T0 then // If a move is found that reduces the threats
 *                              a. move queen Qx to [x, y]
 *                              b. If T = 0 then // If the threats are resolved
 *                               i.return the queen's current position as a solution.
 *                              c. otherwise
 *                               i. go to step 4.
 *                           6. otherwise
 *                              a. Go to Step 1 (restart)
 * 
 * @param  N the size of the board and the number of the queens
 * @param  L the maximun running time of the algorithm
 * @param  S the Seed for srand()
 * 
 * @return void should return nothing
